dolmen.request
==============

Dolmen.request helps you type the request as it comes in 
(think add marker interfaces).

This will trigger the selection of right view or adapters
in publishing process,
so you can choose a different layout (skinning)
or a different redering (eg. json vs html)

As the request is typed an event is also triggered.
